# StreamlineWare
StreamlineWare is an inventory management system that interacts with a local MySQL relational database. This project uses Swing to create a GUI that users can interact with. Users are able to add, remove, edit, and search items. Below is a checklist of the added features thus far. Users will also be able to pull a report for items. This application will run locally on my machine during this class. Once this class is completed I will work on setting up a cloud DB that this can interact with.

### Features
- [X] Add items to DB using GUI
- [x] Remove items from DB using GUI
- [ ] Edit items from DB using GUI
- [x] Search items from DB using GUI
